          Thatâ€™s the main thing people are controlled by! Thoughts- their
          perception of themselves! They&#39;re slowed down by their perception
          of themselves. If you&#39;re taught you can&#39;t do anything, you
          won&#39;t do anything. I was taught I could do everything.
